# Churn-Analysis
Predict Customer Churn with Python and Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using a machine learning model. 
The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave (churn) and those who are likely to stay, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. 
The analysis includes evaluating the model's performance using key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

Analysis Workflow

Data Preparation
The project begins by loading and preparing the dataset, which includes customer information and whether they have churned.
Key steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

Model Training
A machine learning model was trained to predict whether a customer will churn (label 1) or stay (label 0).
Various algorithms were tested, and the best-performing model was selected based on its performance metrics.

Results Interpretation
Non-Churners (Class 0): The model achieved a high precision of 85% and a recall of 91%, indicating strong performance in correctly identifying customers who are not likely to churn.
Churners (Class 1): The model's precision for identifying churners is 69%, with a recall of 56%. While it can identify a reasonable number of actual churners, there is room for improvement, particularly in capturing all potential churners.
Overall Accuracy: The model has an accuracy of 82%, which is satisfactory, but enhancing recall for churners is critical for better proactive customer retention.

Conclusion
The model is effective at identifying non-churn customers but requires improvement in detecting churners. 
This analysis suggests that additional features or further model tuning could enhance the model's ability to predict customer churn more accurately.
